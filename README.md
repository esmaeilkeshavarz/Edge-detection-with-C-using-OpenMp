# Edge-detection-with-C-using-OpenMp
This project consist of phases . In first phase edge detection is done without using OpenMp and no optimization has been applied.
In the second phase OpenMp is used to optimize and reduce the cost of the heaviest function which apply the stencil matrix on a 6000*6000 
pixel png file and in the third phase memory optimization has been applied to see the performance of the code.
